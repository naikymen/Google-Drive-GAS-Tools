# driveFolderCopy
I reused the code here, adapted for my needs: https://ctrlq.org/code/19979-copy-folders-drive. Differences are that this works. Initially i could not get it to work without modification.

# Usage
1. Check that it will do what you need.
2. Make your own google script, copy the contents into it.
3. Replace the source and target folder ID's with the ones that suit you.
4. Optional: change the added string to the copied folder.
5. Give it permissions and run it.

# Alternatives
Use the Chrome OS file manager, it is much simpler if you can use it on your computer.
I know no other ways to do this than installing Chrome OS, which may not be simpler at all.

# Warnings
I have not tested this thoroughly with large folders and many files, only as much as 300 files per run, but not always.

# Would like to do, but donÂ´t know how
Have it work from the contextual menu that appears in the drive web interface, i.e. Right Click a folder > "Open With" > "Connect more apps".
